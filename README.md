The Air Quality Index is based on measurement of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), 
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. 
Most of the stations on the map are monitoring both PM2.5 and PM10 data, but there are few exceptions where only PM10 is available.

The World Air Quality Index project might look big, but it is actually a small but motivated team behind it. There are still many things that the project team want to achieve:


Current contributions,
from 115 countries
Forecast: Improve exising forecast model or add new the forecast model to our forecast page.
Coverage: Increase world-wide air quality monitoring coverage, especially for Middle-East and Africa.
Documentation: Write explanatory articles about air pollution.
Translation: Provide translations for up to 100 languages.
Data Science: Provide free data over the whole historical records.
Consumer Product: Review air purfiers, air monitors, masks.
Engineering: Develop new applications and visualizations.
